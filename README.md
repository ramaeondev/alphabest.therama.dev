# Happy Letters - Interactive Typing Application for Kids

A fun and educational typing application for children to learn letters and numbers through interactive typing, animations, and visual/audio feedback. This application is designed to help children learn the alphabet and numbers in an engaging way.

## Features

- **Interactive Keyboard**: Virtual and physical keyboard support for typing letters and numbers
- **Visual Feedback**: Animated letters with colorful visual effects
- **Audio Feedback**: Voice pronunciation with male/female voice options
- **Educational Content**: Each letter is paired with 10 different words and images
- **Accessibility**: Dark/Light mode toggle for comfortable viewing
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices from mobile phones to desktops
- **Real-time Feedback**: Visual keyboard feedback shows which key is pressed
- **Speech Synthesis**: Uses the browser's speech synthesis API for pronunciation

## How It Works

1. **Type or Click**: Use your keyboard or click/tap the on-screen keys
2. **See & Hear**: Watch the animated letter appear and hear its pronunciation
3. **Learn Words**: For each letter, see a related word and image
4. **Explore**: Each letter cycles through 10 different words when pressed repeatedly

## Technical Implementation

### Components Structure

- `TypingGame`: Main component that manages the game state and logic
- `Keyboard`: Virtual keyboard component with interactive keys
- `AnimatedLetter`: Handles letter animations and visual effects
- `ImageDisplay`: Manages image display for each word
- `VoiceSelector`: Allows switching between male and female voices

### Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the UI components
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better code organization
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive styling and design
- **Speech Synthesis API**: For letter and word pronunciation
- **Unsplash API**: For high-quality word-related images

### Key Features Explained

#### Speech Synthesis

The application uses the browser's native Speech Synthesis API to pronounce letters and words. Users can choose between male and female voices.

```typescript
const speakLetter = (letter: string, word: string) => {
  const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(`${letter}. ${word}`);
  utterance.voice = selectedVoice;
  window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
};
```

#### Image Management

Images are dynamically fetched from Unsplash based on the word being displayed. The application maintains a mapping between words and image URLs.

```typescript
const getExternalImageUrl = (word: string) => {
  // Try to find a matching image URL for this specific word
  if (wordImageMap[word.toLowerCase()]) {
    return wordImageMap[word.toLowerCase()];
  }
  
  // Fall back to letter-based images
  const letterImages = letterImageMap[word.charAt(0).toUpperCase()];
  return letterImages[word.length % letterImages.length];
};
```

#### Keyboard Animation

The keyboard provides visual feedback when keys are pressed, enhancing the interactive experience.

```typescript
<button
  className={`${isActive 
    ? "scale-110 ring-2 ring-offset-2 ring-purple-500" 
    : "active:scale-95"}`}
>
  {key}
</button>
```

#### Word Cycling

Each letter cycles through 10 different words when pressed repeatedly, providing variety and increasing learning opportunities.

```typescript
const handleLetterPress = (letter: string) => {
  const currentCount = letterCounter[letter] !== undefined ? letterCounter[letter] : 0;
  const newCount = (currentCount + 1) % 10;
  setLetterCounter(prev => ({...prev, [letter]: newCount}));
  
  const wordAndImage = itemsMapping.current[letter][newCount];
  setCurrentWordAndImage(wordAndImage);
};
```

## Development

This project is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Future Enhancements

- Word pronunciation speed control
- Custom word lists and images
- Progress tracking for learners
- Game modes (quiz, matching, etc.)
- Multilingual support
- Parental controls and statistics
- Downloadable content for offline usage
